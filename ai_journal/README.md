# ai_journal

A new Flutter project.

We are building a journal app that allows you to write your thoughts and feelings and get a summary of your journal.

This journal is targeting teenagers and young adults who are having trouble accessing mental health services. AI will help them get a summary of their journal and help them understand their thoughts and feelings. In addition, through the weather agent, the journal will track if weather affects their mood.

In addition on the front page, AI will generate a summary of the journals and track any changes in their mood and mental health.
